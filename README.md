# VBA-challenge

Hello!


This is a quick readme to go along with the assignment along with the other results.


All code here is my own, but I have extensively referenced Microsoft's own documentation on functions @ https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/overview/ for help along the way.

I have also cannibalised a few bits of code from another VBA script I made for another purpose, likewise my own work, which can be provided if necessary.

There are two significant limitations with this script that I can think of:

One: There is no data verification. The script assumes that all data will appear in a standard table with headers as provided, and does not search for this, it simply assumes it is there and complete.

Two: The data must be sorted. A simple sort by date within ticker would solve this problem but this is not requested by the assignment and adds likely unnecessary complexity to the assignment, thus it was not included but could be done!

Finally, I wonder what "Seperate VBA Script **FILES**" refers to in the rubric as I only have one script. Though I could do each page through another sub, I believe this is unnecessary as we are only repeating this three times. Were this to scale to an indefinite number of pages, yeah, that'd be a good idea as well.
